%% This module deals with parsing Java properties files,
%% see <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html</a>,
%% especially the load function
%%
%% This module makes part of rberl, a library that provides functionality
%% similar to Java's resource bundles (see tutorial for java resource bundles at
%% <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/i18n/resbundle/index.html">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/i18n/resbundle/index.html</a>)

%%
%% <h2>HERE BE LIONS.</h2> Documentation for properties files. Quoted almost word for word from the javadocs
%%
%% The spec for .properties files is weird, to say the least.
%%
%% <h3>Incoming data</h3>
%%
%% The stream is assumed to be using the ISO 8859-1 character encoding; that is each byte is one Latin1 character.
%% Characters not in Latin1, and certain special characters, can be represented in keys and elements using escape sequences
%% similar to those used for character and string literals (see 
%% <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/lexical.doc.html#100850">3.3</a> and
%% <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/lexical.doc.html#101089">3.10.6</a> of the Java Language Specification).
%% The differences from the character escape sequences used for characters and strings are:
%% <ul>
%%   <li>Octal escapes are not recognized.</li>
%%   <li>The character sequence \b does not represent a backspace character (see next for treatment of backslashes).</li>
%%   <li>The method does not treat a backslash character, \, before a non-valid escape character as an error;
%%       the backslash is silently dropped. For example, in a Java string the sequence "\z" would cause a compile time error.
%%       In contrast, this method silently drops the backslash. Therefore, this method treats the two character sequence "\b"
%%       as equivalent to the single character 'b'.</li>
%%   <li>Escapes are not necessary for single and double quotes; however, by the rule above, single and double quote characters
%%       preceded by a backslash still yield single and double quote characters, respectively.</li>
%% </ul>
%%
%% <strong>Unlike it's Java counterpart, the module doesn't yet throw any exceptions if a malformed Unicode escape appears in the
%%         input, other than possible exceptions by the unicode module. It doesn't attempt to recover from any such errors either</strong>
%%
%% <h3>Lines</h3>
%%
%% This module processes input in terms of lines. A natural line of input is terminated 
%% either by a set of line terminator characters (\n or \r or \r\n) or by the end of the file.
%% A natural line may be either a blank line, a comment line, or hold some part of a key-element pair.
%%
%% The logical line holding all the data for a key-element pair may be spread out across several
%% adjacent natural lines by escaping the line terminator sequence with a backslash character, \.
%%
%% Note that a comment line cannot be extended in this manner; every natural line that is a comment
%% must have its own comment indicator, as described below. If a logical line is continued
%% over several natural lines, the continuation lines receive further processing, also described below.
%% Lines are read from the input stream until end of file is reached.
%%
%% <h3>Blank lines and comments</h3>
%%
%% A natural line that contains only white space characters is considered blank and is ignored.
%% A comment line has an ASCII '#' or '!' as its first non-white space character; comment lines
%% are also ignored and do not encode key-element information. In addition to line terminators,
%% this module considers the characters space (' ', '\u0020'), tab ('\t', '\u0009'), and form feed ('\f', '\u000C') to be white space.
%%
%% <h3>Values spanning several lines</h3>
%%
%% If a logical line is spread across several natural lines, the backslash escaping the line terminator sequence,
%% the line terminator sequence, and any white space at the start the following line have no affect on the key or element values.
%% The remainder of the discussion of key and element parsing will assume all the characters constituting the key and element
%% appear on a single natural line after line continuation characters have been removed.
%% Note that it is not sufficient to only examine the character preceding a line terminator sequence to see
%% if the line terminator is escaped; there must be an odd number of contiguous backslashes for the line terminator
%% to be escaped. Since the input is processed from left to right, a non-zero even number of 2n contiguous backslashes
%% before a line terminator (or elsewhere) encodes n backslashes after escape processing.
%%
%% <h3>Key-value pairs</h3>
%%
%% The key contains all of the characters in the line starting with the first non-white space character
%% and up to, but not including, the first unescaped '=', ':', or white space character other than
%% a line terminator. All of these key termination characters may be included in the key by
%% escaping them with a preceding backslash character; for example,
%% <pre><code>
%%   \:\=
%% </code></pre>
%%
%% would be the two-character key ":=". Line terminator characters can be included using \r and \n
%% escape sequences. Any white space after the key is skipped; if the first non-white space character
%% after the key is '=' or ':', then it is ignored and any white space characters after it are also skipped.
%% All remaining characters on the line become part of the associated element string;
%% if there are no remaining characters, the element is the empty string "".
%% Once the raw character sequences constituting the key and element are identified, escape processing
%% is performed as described above.
%%
%% As an example, each of the following three lines specifies the key "Truth" and the associated element value "Beauty":
%% <pre><code>
%%   Truth = Beauty
%%          Truth:Beauty
%%   Truth                  :Beauty
%% </code></pre>
%%
%% As another example, the following three lines specify a single property:
%% <pre><code>
%%   fruits                           apple, banana, pear, \
%%                                    cantaloupe, watermelon, \
%%                                    kiwi, mango
%% </code></pre>
%% The key is "fruits" and the associated element is:
%% <pre><code>
%%   "apple, banana, pear, cantaloupe, watermelon, kiwi, mango"
%% </code></pre>
%% Note that a space appears before each \ so that a space will appear after each comma in the final result;
%% the \, line terminator, and leading white space on the continuation line are merely discarded and are not
%% replaced by one or more other characters.
%%
%%As a third example, the line:
%% <pre><code>
%%   cheeses
%% </code></pre>
%%
%% specifies that the key is "cheeses" and the associated element is the empty string "".
